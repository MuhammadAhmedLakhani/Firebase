----Firebase


*first step is to connect firebase with javascript

--conectting firebase


*click add app and choose web
*provide project name and copy the code and make a new javascript file lik it with html and paste the code in firebase.js file
*this code basically initialize/connect javascript with firebase

--important

*always keep script tag of firebase before(up) the app.js file


---authentications


*for authentication import getAuth method of firebase through cdn
*cdn can simply be made by copying initializeApp method cdn 
and then replacing getAuth with initializeApp method and also replaceing cdn with only  from 'firebase-app' to 'firebase-auth'  

*then pass the app top to getAuth method

*we then similarly import   createUserWithEmailAndPassword with auth as its part of auth no need of another cdn


---Authentication :importing them in app.js


*we import getAuth and createUserWithEmailAndPassword in app .js


*we create a function called signup and paste the code hte firebase give in docs for authenticaation

*within the code given email and password reuqired which we need to get from the user






(-----important-----)

*in module javascript function declared in glov=bal acope are not  acessible everywhere in project 

*like signup method is not acessible in inex.html

*so we cannot us event onClick on signupform to call the signup method with it as it is not acessible in index.html

* so will use addEventListener method with click event 

(-----important-----)

*in firebase project we have service providers we need to select 
the email/password provider

*initially there will be no user data under users tab

*so when email and is is given by user the information is then sent to firebase under "users" tab



*among the user data there is   uID which is userID 

*acessToken is very important
*acessToken is in hash and has information about user which is hidden

*acessToken is very activity sensitibv=e and get you logout
with in seconds use in banking apps
